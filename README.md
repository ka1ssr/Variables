Simple demonstration program. It really doesn't do anything exciting. Just assigns two
fields (variables), performs some simple math, and then prints out the result.

Originally written to acquaint myself with basic java development and git workflow
concepts. You're Welcome to use this program to do the same if you're just starting
out like I am.
